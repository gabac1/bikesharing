# Analysis on Citibike

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of the analysis is to achieve a deep understanding of the business model of Citibike in New York City. The results would serve as a guide for the proposed similar program in Des Moines.

## Results:

Several observations can be made on the visualizations of the data. First, most of the trips are short ones, with the distribution of trip durations centralize around 5 minutes. Interestingly, for the people who did not provide gender information, their trip durations are more evenly distributed. The starting times of the trips distribute differently between weekday and weekend. The starting times concentrate around the start and end of the working hours during workdays, whereas during weekends, the starting times are distributed more evenly around noon. In total, there are more male users than female users, yet the two groups' usage preferences are not very different. Also, the number of subscribers is way bigger than the number of customers. Both the starting and ending locations of trips cluster in the downtown and midtown Manhattan.

## Summary:
In sum, the activeness of the usage of the bike service varies significantly across locations, times, and genders. To augment the above analysis, a visualization of pure inflow/outflow of bikes at each location at the end of each day could be added to determine necessary logistics arrangements. With data of other months of the year, a visualization of numbers of total trips in each month may also be added, which could be useful for determining the seasonality of usage.
